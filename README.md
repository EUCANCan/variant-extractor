# VCF variant extractor<!-- omit in toc -->
**Deterministic and standard extractor of indels, SNVs and structural variants (SVs)** from VCF files built under the frame of [EUCANCan](https://eucancan.com/)'s second work package. `variant_extractor` is a Python package (**requires Python version 3.6 or higher**) and provides a set of classes and functions to read and extract variants from VCF files in a **deterministic and standard** way. Check the [available documentation](https://eucancan.github.io/variant-extractor/) for more information. The package is designed to be used in a pipeline, where the variants are ingested from VCF files and then used in downstream analysis.

While there is somewhat of an agreement on how to label the SNVs and indels variants, this is not the case for the structural variants. In the current scenario, different labeling between variant callers makes comparisons between structural variants difficult. This package provides an unified interface to extract variants (included structural variants) from VCFs generated by different variant callers. Apart from reading the VCF file, the `variant_extractor` **adds a preprocessing layer to homogenize the variants** extracted from the file. This way, the variants can be used in downstream analysis in a consistent way. For more information about the homogenization process, check the [homogenization rules](#homogenization-rules) section.

**WARNING: VCF entries with multiple ALT values are ignored. It is highly recommended to normalize the VCF file before processing it.**

### BracketSVRecord
The `BracketSVRecord` class is a container for the information contained in a VCF record for SVs with bracket notation.

| Property  | Type            | Description                                                                                                    |

| `suffix`  | `Optional[str]` | Suffix of the SV record with bracket notation. For example, for `G]17:198982]` the suffix will be `None`       |

### ShorthandSVRecord
The `ShorthandSVRecord` class is a container for the information contained in a VCF record for SVs with shorthand notation.

| Property | Type        | Description                                                                                                                                                                |

## VariantType
The `VariantType` enum is a container for the information about the type of the variant. For structural variants is inferred **only** from the bracket notation, it does not take into account any `INFO` (fields `SVTYPE` or `EVENTYPE`).

| REF       | ALT                                      | Variant name | Description                                                   |
| --------- | ---------------------------------------- | ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------- |

| A         | A. or .A                                 | SGL          | Single breakend                                               |

## Homogenization rules
The `variant_extractor` package provides a unified interface to extract variants (included structural variants) from VCF files generated by different variant callers. The variants are homogenized and returned applying the following rules:

### SNVs
Entries with `REF/ALT` of the same lenghts are treated like SNVs. If the `REF/ALT` sequences are more than one nucleotide (MNPs), they are divided into multiple atomic SNVs. For example:

| CHROM | POS | ID      | REF | ALT | FILTER |
| ----- | --- | ------- | --- | --- | ------ |
| 2     | 1   | event_1 | C   | G   | PASS   |
| 2     | 3   | event_2 | TAG | AGT | PASS   |

are returned as:

| CHROM | POS | ID        | REF | ALT | FILTER | [`VariantType`](#varianttype) |
| ----- | --- | --------- | --- | --- | ------ | ----------------------------- |
| 2     | 3   | event_1   | C   | G   | PASS   | SNV                           |
| 2     | 3   | event_2_0 | T   | A   | PASS   | SNV                           |
| 2     | 4   | event_2_1 | A   | G   | PASS   | SNV                           |
| 2     | 5   | event_2_2 | G   | T   | PASS   | SNV                           |

### Compound indels
All entries with the `REF/ALT` of different lengths are treated as compound indels and are left-trimmed and divided into multiple atomic SNVs and an insertion (INS) or a deletion (DEL). If the `REF` sequence is longer than the `ALT` sequence, it is considered a deletion. If the `REF` sequence is shorter than the `ALT` sequence, it is considered an insertion. For example:

| CHROM | POS  | ID           | REF     | ALT       | FILTER |
| ----- | ---- | ------------ | ------- | --------- | ------ |
| 1     | 2000 | standard_del | CT      | C         | PASS   |
| 1     | 2100 | standard_ins | C       | CAA       | PASS   |
| 1     | 2200 | compund_del  | CCTGAAA | CGA       | PASS   |
| 1     | 2300 | compund_ins  | GT      | CAATATATA | PASS   |

are returned as:

| CHROM | POS  | ID            | REF   | ALT      | FILTER | [`VariantType`](#varianttype) |
| ----- | ---- | ------------- | ----- | -------- | ------ | ----------------------------- |
| 1     | 2000 | standard_del  | CT    | C        | PASS   | DEL                           |
| 1     | 2100 | standard_ins  | C     | CAA      | PASS   | INS                           |
| 1     | 2201 | compund_del_0 | C     | G        | PASS   | SNV                           |
| 1     | 2202 | compund_del_1 | TGAAA | T        | PASS   | DEL                           |
| 1     | 2202 | compund_del_2 | T     | A        | PASS   | SNV                           |
| 1     | 2300 | compund_ins_0 | G     | C        | PASS   | SNV                           |
| 1     | 2301 | compund_ins_1 | T     | TATATATA | PASS   | DEL                           |
| 1     | 2301 | compund_ins_2 | T     | A        | PASS   | SNV                           |


### Structural variants
`variant_extractor` returns one entry per structural variant (one entry per breakend pair). This helps to avoid the ambiguity of the notation and keeps the process deterministic. Also, for this reason, in case of paired breakends, the breakend with the lowest chromosome and/or position is returned.

#### Bracket vs shorthand notation
Entries with the same information, either described with shorthand or bracket notation, will be tagged the same way. Here is an example for a DEL entry:

| CHROM | POS  | ID        | REF | ALT       | FILTER | INFO                 |
| ----- | ---- | --------- | --- | --------- | ------ | -------------------- |
| 1     | 3000 | event_1_o | A   | A[1:5000[ | PASS   | SVTYPE=BND           |
| 1     | 5000 | event_1_h | A   | ]1:3000]A | PASS   | SVTYPE=BND           |
| 1     | 3000 | event_1   | A   | A[1:5000[ | PASS   | SVTYPE=DEL           |
| 1     | 3000 | event_1   | A   | \<DEL\>   | PASS   | SVTYPE=DEL; END=5000 |

are returned as one entry (each one of them with their own `ALT` field), but with the same `VariantRecord.end` and `VariantType`:

| CHROM | POS  | ID      | REF | ALT | FILTER | INFO | [`VariantType`](#varianttype) | [`VariantRecord.end`](#variantrecord) |
| ----- | ---- | ------- | --- | --- | ------ | ---- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| 2     | 3000 | event_1 | A   | ... | PASS   | ...  | DEL                           | 5000                                  |

##### INV special case<!-- omit in toc -->
\<INV\> is a special case of shorthand notation because it represents two paired breakends. For example, the following shorthand notation:

| CHROM | POS    | ID   | REF | ALT     | FILTER | INFO                  |
| ----- | ------ | ---- | --- | ------- | ------ | --------------------- |
| 2     | 321682 | INV0 | T   | \<INV\> | PASS   | SVTYPE=INV;END=421681 |

is equivalent to the following breakends:

| CHROM | POS    | ID      | REF | ALT         | FILTER | INFO       |
| ----- | ------ | ------- | --- | ----------- | ------ | ---------- |
| 2     | 321681 | event_1 | .   | .]2:421681] | PASS   | SVTYPE=BND |
| 2     | 321682 | event_1 | T   | [2:421682[T | PASS   | SVTYPE=BND |

In this case, `variant_extractor` converts internally \<INV\> to two entries with bracket notation (one for each breakend pair).


#### Paired breakends
For **paired breakends**, breakends are paired using their coordinates (contig+position). The breakend with the lowest chromosome and/or position is returned. For example:

| CHROM | POS  | ID        | REF | ALT       | FILTER | INFO       |
| ----- | ---- | --------- | --- | --------- | ------ | ---------- |
| 2     | 3000 | event_1_o | T   | T[3:5000[ | PASS   | SVTYPE=BND |
| 3     | 5000 | event_1_h | T   | ]2:3000]T | PASS   | SVTYPE=BND |
| 1     | 3000 | event_2_o | A   | A[1:5000[ | PASS   | SVTYPE=BND |
| 1     | 5000 | event_2_h | A   | ]1:3000]A | PASS   | SVTYPE=BND |

are returned as one entry per variant:

| CHROM | POS  | ID        | REF | ALT       | FILTER | INFO       | [`VariantType`](#varianttype) |
| ----- | ---- | --------- | --- | --------- | ------ | ---------- | ----------------------------- |
| 2     | 3000 | event_1_o | T   | T[3:5000[ | PASS   | SVTYPE=BND | TRN                           |
| 1     | 3000 | event_2_o | A   | A[1:5000[ | PASS   | SVTYPE=BND | DEL                           |

#### Imprecise paired breakends
Imprecise breakends with bracket notation are paired using the `INFO` fields `MATEID` or `PARID` instead of their coordinates (since they may not match). In order to keep the deterministic process, as with the rest of variants, only the breakend with the lowest chromosome and/or position is returned. However, it is important to notice that the uncertainty information (`CIPOS` field) is lost for the other breakend. For example:

| CHROM | POS  | ID        | REF | ALT       | FILTER | INFO                             |
| ----- | ---- | --------- | --- | --------- | ------ | -------------------------------- |
| 2     | 3010 | event_1_o | T   | T[3:5000[ | PASS   | SVTYPE=BND;CIPOS=0,50;PARID=a_h  |
| 3     | 5050 | event_1_h | T   | ]2:3050]T | PASS   | SVTYPE=BND;CIPOS=0,100;PARID=a_o |

are returned as one entry:

| CHROM | POS  | ID        | REF | ALT       | FILTER | INFO                            | [`VariantType`](#varianttype) |
| ----- | ---- | --------- | --- | --------- | ------ | ------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| 2     | 3010 | event_1_o | T   | T[3:5000[ | PASS   | SVTYPE=BND;CIPOS=0,50;PARID=a_h | TRN                           |


#### Single breakends
Single breakends cannot be matched with other breakends because they lack a mate. That is why each one is kept as a different variant. For example:

| CHROM | POS  | ID  | REF | ALT | FILTER | INFO       |
| ----- | ---- | --- | --- | --- | ------ | ---------- |
| 2     | 3000 | a_s | T   | T.  | PASS   | SVTYPE=BND |
| 3     | 5000 | m_s | G   | .G  | PASS   | SVTYPE=BND |

are be returned as two entries:

| CHROM | POS  | ID  | REF | ALT | FILTER | INFO       | [`VariantType`](#varianttype) |
| ----- | ---- | --- | --- | --- | ------ | ---------- | ----------------------------- |
| 2     | 3000 | a_s | T   | T.  | PASS   | SVTYPE=BND | SGL                           |
| 3     | 5000 | m_s | G   | .G  | PASS   | SVTYPE=BND | SGL                           |
